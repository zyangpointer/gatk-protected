/**
 * The CopyRatio Hidden Markov Model is a generative model describing latent CNV states
 * with different copy ratios.
 *
 * Hidden states are essentially minor allele fractions f, but for convenience we represent them
 * as integers 0, 1, . . . K - 1 and store copy ratios in a corresponding array.
 *
 * The model contains a memory length parameter representing the prior probability for the minor
 * allele fraction state to be "forgotten" as a function of distance d between consecutive SNPs --
 * the probability to remember a state is exp(-d/memoryLength).  If the state is forgotten, a new state
 * is chosen with probabilities given by an array of weights.
 *
 * Thus our transition probabilities are P(i -> j) = exp(-d/D) delta_{ij} + (1 - exp(-d/D) weights[j]
 * where delta is the Kronecker delta and D is the memory length.
 *
 * Emission likelihoods as a function of copy ratio are assumed Gaussian with a shared global variance.
